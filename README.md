### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

1 - Clone the challenge repository
2 - I analyzed the centerpieces of the design
3 - I made an html file with the structure of the components
4 - I added the first styles of the main component layout with css
5 - I added the variables (colors, fonts, spacing) in the css that were in the style guide and placed them in the corresponding css classes
6 - I created a javascript document to handle component interactivity
7 - Refactored the styles, interactivity and accessibility of all components
8 - Deploy my solution on the git hub pages
9 - I compared my solution with those of other participants
10 - I refactored all the styles to be as "pixel perfect" as possible

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Variables
- Responsive Webdesign
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

- I learned enough from the trial and error process for my solution to look exactly like the original solution.

- I searched a lot of codes on google on how to make certain parts of the component.

- I also learned to refactor: think of more elegant solutions to solve the same problem.
